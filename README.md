# supplierPartsDB
a simple database application connecting to the supplierParts database with python and flask

Software and Tools I used for this project:
1. IDE: Visual Studio Code
2. Database: MySQLWorkBench
3. Flask: Frontend
4. Python: Backend
5. Google Web Browser: To run my website

Steps to run the project:
Where to download or install the IDE and other tools:
1. Download Visual Studio Code on your system:
     https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
2. On VS Code, install the ‘Python’ extension.
3. Download MySQLWorkbench and create the required database (supplierParts).
4. Open VS Code and open the terminal on it. Then enter the following command to install Flask:
     pip3 install Flask
5. On VS Code, install the ’SQLTools’ extension. 
6. On VS Code, install the ’SQLTools MySQL/MariaDB/TiDB’ extension.
7. Then, create a new connection which connects you to the supplierParts database. You will have to enter the same credentials you use to connect to the database on MySQLWorkbench. The connection will have a green dot on it if it is connected. ( This is assuming you have the database created on your MySQLWorkbench. If you do not have the database created, you will have to create it.)

How to compile my program:
8. Once the database is connected, you can download the code (full project) on your system to VS Code.
9. Now we are ready to run the application. On VS Code, open the terminal and run the following command:
   python3 app.py

How to execute my program:
10. This will run the application. You will see : ‘* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000…..’
    Ctrl+click on the link and it will take you to the website. (cmd+clink on the link if you are using a Mac)
11. Once the application runs successfully, you can click each link to run a different task.
